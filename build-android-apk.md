## 🚀 Building the APK:

Once you have the Android development environment set up:

# Open the Android project in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```
Then in Android Studio:
1. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
2. Select Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)

### Method 2: Using Command Line

`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## 🔧 Development Mode:
To test your app during development:

1. Start your Next.js server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Run the app on Android device/emulator:
```bash
npx cap run android
```

## 📱 Testing:
- Use Android Studio's emulator for testing
- Connect a physical Android device with USB debugging enabled
- The app will connect to your local development server at http://localhost:9003

## 🎯 Production Build:
For production deployment, update the capacitor.config.ts to point to your production server URL instead of localhost.
